# Lecture 3

## How did I prepare before lecture?
 
 I doubled checked that WSL was working for GUI apps and found a problem. I installed beta graphics drivers, and added a couple lines to the .profile file to fix errors. I doubled checked my VSCode install is still working. I also skimed the linux command line book and familerized myself with some of the new to me commands.

  I answered a few questions and followed along with the linux command lecture. 
  
 ## What was or is the most confusing thing? 
 
 The micro text editor was kind of confusing, and seems very hard to use and would be easy to mess something up with.
