I contributed by telling my name, and other things. That is about all.

Nothing was really confusing at all

I made sure WSL 2 was set up for displaying GUI's on windows 11 and installed x-11 apps along with the ubuntu file manager and some other linux apps. 

## How Did I Contribute During Lecture?

I did not really, there was little to contribute.
